# hotel-booking-model-developing

# Overview

This project aims to develop predictive models to determine whether hotel clients will cancel their bookings. By analyzing various factors such as booking lead time, customer type, and market segment, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help hotels reduce losses caused by booking cancellations.

The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology and includes the following phases:

1. **Data Exploration and Preparation**
2. **Data Pre-processing**
3. **Model Creation using Data Mining Algorithms**
4. **Model Evaluation**
